# Numerical-Methods-Animations
A jupyter notebook with python code for creating various animations used while teaching on the numerical methods course at Mahidol University, Faculty of  ICT.

These were created in a bit of a hurry, so the code is rough in places and comments are minimal, but it should be possible to work out what is going on by 
looking at the end result. 

Also includes gifs of the animations.
